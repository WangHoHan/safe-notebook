Project for Mobile Systems Security classes on Computer Science at Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan. Project is about creating well encrypted notebook. This is an iOS application written using the React Native library. It covers following problems:
- Async storage, 
- Biometrics (Face ID), 
- Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators,
- Encryption ciphers, 
- Key derivation functions, 
- Keychain, 
- Hashing, 
- Public-key cryptosystem, 
- Salting.

I am using following tools:
